# German-Playing-Card-Game

Python program that simulates a German Style [Franconian] playing card game. There are four suits: Acorns, Bells, Hearts, Leaves. Each suits consists of 9 cards: the numbers from 6 up to 10 and four face cards, namely unter, ober, konig and ace (for sergeant, officer, king and ace respectively respectively).

The hands(filename_in) function consumes a string filename_in corresponding to a valid file and returns the hands of each player in a game as a dictionary of the type (dictof Str (listof Card)).
